# Digital Empowerment Pakistan (DEP) Internship
## Creating Profile using HTML & CSS
In this first task of DEP internship I have created my profile (Resume) via HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Casecading Stylesheet) with the enthusiastic dedication.
All my qualifications, past experiences and skills are mentioned in it.
I hope it would adorn my creativity and skill that I have, and will fulfill the attractiveness that I want to put on.
### Thanks to DEP Team
